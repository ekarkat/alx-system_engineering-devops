# The Great Authentication Adventure: Postmortem

## Issue Summary

- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: January 21, 2024, 15:30 UTC
  - End Time: January 21, 2024, 18:45 UTC

- **Impact:**
  - The authentication service took an unscheduled vacation, leaving 25% of users stranded without access to their accounts.

- **Root Cause:**
  - The load balancer played favorites, causing traffic inequality and disrupting service. It turns out, load balancers are not the best at sharing.

## Timeline

- **Issue Detection:**
  - Automated monitoring alerts triggered at 15:30 UTC, declaring an emergency.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - The team, armed with coffee and determination, investigated the authentication service, suspecting database mischief.
  - Assumption: Initially thought the database was having a bad day.

- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Extensive database log analysis, resembling a Sherlock Holmes mystery, turned out to be more like a Scooby-Doo ghost chase.
  - Briefly considered blaming a DDoS attack, but reality was more about user frustration than cyber villains.

- **Escalation:**
  - Called in reinforcements - DevOps and Infrastructure teams - as our investigation turned into a high-stakes drama.
  - Collaborated with the Security team, just in case our load balancer was targeted by cyber-criminal masterminds.

- **Resolution:**
  - Eureka! Discovered the load balancer was playing favorites. Adjusted settings, scolded the misbehaving load balancer, and implemented a hotfix to restore order to the authentication kingdom.
  - Celebrated with virtual high-fives as the service got back on its feet at 18:45 UTC.

## Root Cause and Resolution

- **Root Cause Explanation:**
  - The load balancer, in its attempt to be a social butterfly, misconfigured traffic distribution, causing server envy and service disruptions.
  - Turned out our load balancer needed a crash course in fairness.

- **Resolution Details:**
  - Load balancer settings were scolded and then fixed to treat all servers equally, like a good parent.
  - Implemented a hotfix to stop the load balancer's discrimination party and restore order to the authentication kingdom.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Planning a load balancer intervention to ensure it doesn’t play favorites again.
  - Installing a 'No Server Left Behind' policy.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - **Immediate:**
    - Share this rollercoaster of emotions with the entire engineering team for a good laugh.
    - Schedule a "Load Balancer Fairness" workshop to teach it some manners.

  - **Short-term:**
    - Plan a load balancer configuration overhaul, complete with motivational speeches for fairness.
    - Post-incident review meeting to celebrate our victory and discuss what went wrong, besides the load balancer’s sense of humor.

  - **Long-term:**
    - Implement automated load balancer therapy sessions as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
    - Start a petition to include load balancer fairness in computer science textbooks.

Remember, even in the darkest server rooms, a little humor can light up the way. Stay tuned for the sequel: "Load Balancer's Redemption" - coming to a data center near you!
