# Project Title

## Description

This project aims to provide an introduction to servers, SSH, and RSA key authentication. It covers topics such as server architecture, SSH essentials, creating an SSH RSA key pair, and connecting to a remote host using SSH RSA key pair. Additionally, it explains the advantages of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need access to an Ubuntu server running version 20.04 LTS. This server can be accessed via SSH using an RSA key pair. The public key for authentication should be configured on the server.

### Server Information

You can find the IP address and username for connecting to your server in the "My Servers" section of the intranet.

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment
- SSH client
- RSA key pair

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what a server is and where servers usually reside.
- Understand the basics of SSH and how it works.
- Generate an SSH RSA key pair.
- Connect to a remote host using SSH RSA key pair authentication.
- Understand the advantages of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` in Bash scripts.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure your SSH RSA key pair on the server.
3. Connect to the server using SSH.
4. Execute the desired Bash scripts.
